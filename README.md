- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mohamedbedisse
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in so many things that it would take years to come to an end. But amongst other things, I am interested in fields as different as they may be, such as coding, maths, art and sport. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning applied maths at Polytech Nice Sophia.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me via my LinkedIn profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-bedisse-b2748524a/
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Hmm....I don't know, why would I make myself a weirdo online ?
